# machinelearningproject
For this project, I will be performing an experiment on a cereal dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals.
My goal is to design a model that will accurately predict the cereal manufacturer. My model will take into account explanatory variables such as type, calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, carbohydrates, sugars, potassium, vitamins, shelf, weight, cups, and rating.
I will be performing kNN, wighted kNN, decision trees, and random forests to come to my final decision.
I wish to perform this experiment because I want to be able to develop a model that accurately identifies a cereal manufacturer is I have some product details on a new cereal. This will allow me to figure out which cereal manufacturer best suits my taste.
