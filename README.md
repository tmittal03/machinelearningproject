# machinelearningproject
For this project, I will be performing an experiment on a cereal dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals.
My goal is to design a model that will accurately predict the cereal manufacturer. My model will take into account explanatory variables such as type: cold or hot, calories: calories per serving, protein: grams of protein, fat: grams of fat, sodium: milligrams of sodium, fiber: grams of dietary fiber, carbo: grams of complex carbohydrates, sugars: grams of sugars, potass: milligrams of potassium, vitamins: vitamins and minerals (0, 25, or 100), shelf: display shelf (1, 2, or 3, counting from the floor), weight: weight in ounces of one serving, cups: number of cups in one serving, rating: a rating of the cereals.
